        <h1 >Why is ALM important?</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">ALM helps companies set and meet appropriate requirements for projects. ALM also improves the development process by incorporating frequent, thorough testing. It also helps developers adjust development processes and goals during the software lifecycle. Finally, ALM helps ensure that all teams -- including development, operations and security -- can collaborate effectively to produce the best possible software.

            Furthermore, leading software companies deploy updates for products daily. Application lifecycle management helps businesses achieve high efficiency and gain a competitive edge by accelerating workflows and ensuring that top-quality products get deployed.</p>

        <h1>What is ALM used for?</h1>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">ALM provides a framework for setting requirements and establishing processes, governance and methodologies before deploying software. Thus, ALM supplies the scaffolding within which software gets developed, tested and maintained. By design, it also includes safeguards and checkoffs to ensure that software meets compliance, governance, efficiency, usability, performance and other benchmarks before being released into production. Finally, ALM provides ongoing opportunities to review and adjust costs to meet changing budget requirements and productivity assessments to ensure that companies realize their ROI objectives for software development.</p>
